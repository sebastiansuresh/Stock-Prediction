# Stock-Prediction
Linear regression can be a powerful technique to predict one set of variables knowing the second set of varibles. 
In this project I tried to use regression to predict the price of a given stock at a future date.
Linear regression is commonly used in stock price prediction and even though the predicted price wont be acurate it should predict a close enough value.

The past stock price was imported using quandl and implmenting a dataframe.

```
df = quandl.get('WIKI/GOOGL')
```
